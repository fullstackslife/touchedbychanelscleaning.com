## Setup Instructions

1. Copy `config.template.json` to `config.json`:
   ```bash
   cp config.template.json config.json
   ```

2. Update `config.json` with your actual credentials:
   - HubSpot Portal ID
   - HubSpot Form ID
   - Brevo Conversations ID

3. Never commit `config.json` to version control. It's already in `.gitignore`.

4. For GitHub Pages deployment:
   - Push your code to GitHub
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
   - Set up your custom domain in GitHub Pages settings
